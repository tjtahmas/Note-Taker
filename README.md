## Description

The Note Taker is an API server request driven, text-file database input and repository for keeping track of everyday thoughts and tasks. The motivation for this project was to give an online space to easily input and record personal entries that could be stored on a server. This project was built so that individuals could conveniently store their notes online. It is a convenient place to store entries for any kind of task. This project drew on my skills using API calls, server request management, and data persistance.
